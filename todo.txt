- ui work
    - more detail on detail page! put the stars in there explaining what they are

medium

low priority
- change includes everywhere to extends for base
- footer with links to reddit/discord/steam page
- select_platform with {% for %} loop instead of hardcode
- consider mixtures in tests to make tests cleaner
- for the tables, look into extending instead of including first

unsorted
- create back button on form to select platform
-uplading images is broken
    - it works on desktop. doesn't show select image before submitting
- consider return button on small screens
- more intuitive scrollbar color for manage pawns on phone
- some sort of indicator that the submit button WAS in fact hit, and to scroll up to see errors


- things to lookout for in user testing
    - email confirmation blocking the server... consider timeout on email confirmation


future
